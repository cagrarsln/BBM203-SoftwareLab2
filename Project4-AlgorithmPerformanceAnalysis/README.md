# Algorithm Performance Analysis â€“ BBM204 Project 4

This project evaluates the practical performance of various sorting and searching algorithms by comparing their runtime behaviors with their theoretical complexities.

## ðŸ“š Course Info
- Course: BBM204 â€“ Software Laboratory II
- Semester: Spring 2024

## ðŸ§  Project Description

The following algorithms were implemented and tested:

### Sorting Algorithms:
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Counting Sort

### Searching Algorithms:
- Linear Search
- Binary Search

The algorithms were executed on multiple datasets:
- Randomly ordered data
- Already sorted data
- Reversely sorted data

Performance measurements were recorded and plotted using XChart. The project report (`report.pdf`) includes runtime tables and performance graphs, which support the theoretical analysis of each algorithm.
