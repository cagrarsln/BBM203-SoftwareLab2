# BBM204 - Software Laboratory II (Hacettepe University)

This repository contains four Java-based projects developed for the **BBM204 Software Laboratory II** course at Hacettepe University.

Each project focuses on a distinct software engineering or algorithmic problem, aiming to develop object-oriented, modular, and well-analyzed solutions.

## üìÅ Projects Overview

### üîπ [Project 1: Power Grid Optimization](./Project1-PowerGridOptimization)

Implements an optimization algorithm for energy storage vehicle (ESV) deployment within a power grid. Includes greedy strategies for infrastructure planning.

### üîπ [Project 2: Molecular Mission Simulation](./Project2-MolecularMissionSimulation)

Simulates molecular structures and mission synthesis logic. Includes multiple Java classes for molecule management, structure validation, and bonding logic.

### üîπ [Project 3: Urban Transportation System](./Project3-UrbanTransportationSystem)

Models a smart transportation infrastructure with support for shortest path calculations via Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm and custom graph structures.

### üîπ [Project 4: Algorithm Performance Analysis](./Project4-AlgorithmPerformanceAnalysis)

Analyzes the runtime behavior of several sorting and searching algorithms. Includes experimental results, theoretical complexity analysis, and graph generation using XChart.
