# Urban Transportation System â€“ BBM204 Project 3

This Java project models a smart urban transportation system involving stations, train lines, and route planning. It supports advanced pathfinding using Dijkstra's algorithm.

## ðŸ“š Course Info
- Course: BBM204 â€“ Software Laboratory II
- Semester: Spring 2024

## ðŸ§  Project Description

The simulation handles the following:

- Defining city infrastructure including **stations**, **routes**, and **hyperloop networks**
- Finding shortest paths between stations using **Dijkstra's algorithm**
- Modeling tasks such as infrastructure planning and train route assignments
